# WinForms Splash Screen Manager - How to display a loading panel during a time-consuming operation

The [WinForms Splash Screen Manager](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/10826/controls-and-libraries/forms-and-user-controls/splash-screen-manager) component allows you to display splash screens, loading panels, wait and overlay forms to indicate that an application is busy. This example displays a loading panel ([Wait Form](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/10824/controls-and-libraries/forms-and-user-controls/splash-screen-manager/wait-form)) during a time-consuming operation.
